# Waste-Clasification-By-CNN-Model
"This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurate image-based classification of plastic waste. By effectively categorizing waste, the model will contribute to improved waste management practices, enhanced resource recovery, and ultimately a more sustainable environment."
